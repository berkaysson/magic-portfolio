## Overview

The D'Hondt System Calculator is a web-based application that simplifies the complex D'Hondt method — a mathematical approach used for proportional representation in multi-party elections. It offers users a clean, interactive UI to simulate elections and understand how seats are allocated. The tool is particularly educational for students, political analysts, and election enthusiasts.

With real-world data from the 2023 Turkish General Election, the calculator allows district-level simulations, helping users see how votes translate into seats across Turkey.

## Purpose and Inspiration

The project was born from a desire to make electoral systems more transparent and approachable. The D'Hondt method can be daunting to understand, especially when applied across large electorates. By turning it into a practical, visual tool, the app empowers people to engage with political data and grasp the mechanics of representative democracy in action.

## Key Features

- **Seat Allocation Simulator**: Implements the D'Hondt method in JavaScript for precise, real-time seat calculations.
- **2023 Turkish Election Data**: Includes over 6000 lines of real data, letting users simulate district-level outcomes.
- **Interactive UI**: React-powered frontend built with styled-components for a responsive and aesthetic design.
- **Data Pipeline**: Transformed complex Excel datasets into structured JSON for use within the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Built the interactive UI components and routing.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented the core algorithm for the D’Hondt system.
- **Styled-Components**: Handled component-level styling and layout.
- **CSV-to-JSON Conversion**: Wrote a custom parser to transform raw election data into structured, usable JSON.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Algorithm Accuracy**: Translating a complex voting method into a reliable algorithm required a deep understanding of both the math and its edge cases.
- **Data Acquisition and Processing**: Gathering granular election data for every district in Turkey was a challenge. After manual efforts and outreach, I converted Excel files to CSV and created a data parser to generate a usable JSON dataset exceeding 6000 lines.
- **Frontend Performance**: Handling and displaying such a large dataset interactively demanded efficient rendering and smart component design in React.

## Outcome

This project sharpened my problem-solving skills, particularly around algorithm design and large-scale data transformation. It also strengthened my front-end abilities and gave me real experience building tools that bring clarity to complex systems. The D’Hondt Calculator now serves as both an educational resource and a testament to applying software development to real-world systems.
