## Overview

The Harmonii Music App is a dynamic full-stack project that enables users to discover, stream, and curate playlists of their favorite music. Built with React.js for the frontend and ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework and MSSQL for the backend, it incorporates strong user authentication and authorization mechanisms, including role-based access control.

Admin users can verify accounts, assign moderators, and manage users. Moderators are responsible for managing music content, while regular users enjoy streaming and playlist features. The platform, hosted on Azure, delivers an immersive music experience with a foundation for future expansion.

## Purpose and Inspiration

Harmonii was the culmination of my internship at KoçSistem and served as a capstone for improving my backend development skills in C# with ASP.NET. It was a hands-on journey into relational database architecture, secure APIs, and scalable deployments via Azure. The motivation stemmed from a desire to merge backend engineering principles with real-world application demands in the music tech domain.

## Key Features

- **User Roles & Access Control**: Role-based authentication system using ASP.NET Identity and JWT.
- **Playlist Creation & Music Streaming**: Users can stream audio files and organize them into personal playlists.
- **Admin & Moderator Panels**: Admins manage user accounts; moderators manage music content.
- **Firebase Cloud Storage Integration**: Efficiently handles audio file upload and delivery.
- **Azure Deployment**: Utilized App Service, SQL Server, and Application Insights for a production-ready cloud deployment.
- **Interactive Frontend UI**: Built with React and styled-components, featuring animations via Framer Motion.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Axios, Styled Components, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, MSSQL, ASP.NET Identity, JWT
- **Storage & Deployment**: Firebase Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure (App Service, SQL Server, API Management, Application Insights)

## Challenges and Learnings

Authentication and authorization were complex, especially ensuring secure token handling using JWT and ASP.NET Identity. Audio streaming posed performance concerns, addressed by offloading media handling to Firebase. Designing a normalized, scalable relational database schema also took several iterations.

Integrating frontend-backend communication taught me the importance of concise and intuitive API design. I also developed a deeper understanding of Azure's architecture and how to monitor and deploy applications in a real-world environment.

## Outcome

Harmonii became a fully functional, end-to-end music streaming platform. It strengthened my backend capabilities and gave me practical experience in Azure and Firebase integration. The project validated my ability to architect and deliver real-world applications with distinct user roles, content moderation features, and cloud deployment pipelines.
