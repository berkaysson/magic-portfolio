## Overview

Habivita (previously known as Lifemap) is a personal journey companion designed to empower users in achieving their goals, improving productivity, and building lasting habits. It combines task management, activity logging, and habit tracking in one cohesive platform. With an intuitive dashboard and dynamic visualizations, Habivita offers a clear and insightful look into your progress across all dimensions of life.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Provides a high-level overview of habits, tasks, and activities with charts and analytics that make tracking progress intuitive.
- **Activity Logging**: Users can log time spent on any activity (e.g., study, fitness, hobbies) to gain insights and inform goal-setting.
- **To-Do Management**: Create and manage simple, actionable to-dos. Mark them as completed or pending to keep your short-term goals organized.
- **Task Tracking**: Define goals with specific deadlines and monitor their progress dynamically based on your logged time, not just status toggles.
- **Habit Formation**: Build and sustain habits with frequency settings and recurring activity definitions to promote consistency and personal growth.
- **Project Management**: Group related tasks and to-dos into structured projects that align with larger life goals or work initiatives.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend & Backend**:
  - **Next.js** (with server-side rendering)
  - **TypeScript**
  - **Tanstack Query** (for efficient data fetching and caching)
  - **NextAuth** (for secure authentication)

- **Database & Hosting**:
  - **PostgreSQL**
  - **Prisma** (ORM)
  - **Supabase** (for real-time database features and authentication)
  - **Vercel** (for fast and scalable deployment)

- **Styling & UI**:
  - **TailwindCSS**
  - **Shadcn UI**
  - **Material UI**

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a unified system that tracks both qualitative (habits, to-dos) and quantitative (time-logged activities) data presented architectural challenges. Dynamic updates, cross-component syncing, and visual consistency were top priorities.

Handling authentication, database schema design for flexible task types, and visualizing time-based data with clarity also pushed the boundaries of UI/UX and performance optimization in a full-stack application.

## Outcome

Habivita evolved into a robust, user-centric app that empowers individuals to gain control over their time and aspirations. It allowed me to deepen my skills in full-stack development, particularly with Next.js, Supabase, and scalable UI design using modern libraries.

The project stands as a reflection of my passion for productivity tools, thoughtful design, and building software that adds meaning to everyday life.
